Cascading Style Sheets , or Cascading Style Sheets ( Cascading Style Sheets , CSS) is a markup language, a language that describes how the actual display [1] , HTML and XHTML mainly used in, XML can be used in. It is a W3C standard and has a high degree of freedom in defining layouts and styles.

If the markup language is responsible for the body of the website, then CSS can be a decorative part of clothes and accessories. In other words, changing the CSS file without changing the HTML structure can make it look like a completely different website.

CSS3, which is currently under development , has added the ability to replace images created by graphic editing programs such as shadow effects, gradients, and transformations. In addition, various animation features have been added to replace Adobe Flash to some extent.
